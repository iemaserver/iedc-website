# IEDC IEM Salt Lake - Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center (IEDC) at IEM Salt Lake. The application serves as a comprehensive digital platform showcasing the center's mission, team, incubated startups, and activities. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an engaging user experience with a professional design system.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing instead of React Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom IEDC brand colors
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent, accessible UI components
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management and caching

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **Node.js** runtime environment
- **Modular routing system** with separation of concerns
- **Memory storage implementation** with interface for easy database migration
- **Error handling middleware** for consistent error responses

### Database Layer
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with Neon Database
- **Schema-first approach** with TypeScript type generation
- **Zod validation** integrated with database schemas
- **Migration system** using Drizzle Kit

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Layout System**: Navigation, Footer, and responsive design
- **Page Components**: Home, About, Team, Events, Gallery, Contact, Innovation section (Startups, Patents, Research Grants, Publications, Projects)
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library implementation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

### Backend Services
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted data layer supporting multiple implementations
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints with `/api` prefix
- **Static File Serving**: Vite integration for development and production builds
- **Request Logging**: Detailed logging for API requests with response times

### Data Models
- **User Schema**: Basic user management with username/password authentication
- **Extensible Schema**: Easy to add new entities like startups, events, gallery items

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls through TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle requests and interact with storage layer
3. **Data Storage**: Storage interface abstracts database operations
4. **Response Caching**: TanStack Query caches responses for optimal performance
5. **UI Updates**: React components automatically re-render on data changes
